## Overview

Monopolize is a twist on Monopoly with a Galvanize theme.  It was created for a group project in under a week.  We decided a game would be a fun challenge and had a lot of fun building it and learning along the way.  Four players are able to play and choose their tokens at the beginning.  They are then prompted with choices after they roll the die.  The player dashboard allows all players to see each others deeds and current balance. The winner is the last player standing, if you make it through a whole game.
