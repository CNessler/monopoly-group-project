## Overview

Monopolize is a Node.js Galvanize-themed Monopoly game written in raw JavaScript, complete with ping-pong utilities and a faulty elevator as the jail (yes, people actually get stuck in the elevator at the Galvanize Platte campus).

This project was completed in 5 days after 3 months of instruction by four students in the [Galvanize Full Stack](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/full-stack/) program in Denver, Colorado, USA.

## How to Play
1. On the home page, enter player names and select token, or simply click "Start Game" for a quick start.
2. Click the dice to roll, and watch your piece appear on the board.
3. Follow the directions displayed on the card you see after you roll the dice - buy properties, pay rent, get stuck in the elevator (go straight to jail), and more.
4. Click around on the player dashboard to see who owns which properties, buy houses, and mortgage deeds.
5. Drive your opponents out of business and monopolize the board. The last player standing wins!

## Notes:

If you start the game with more than four players on the dashboard, simply log out and restart the game.
